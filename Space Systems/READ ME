Overview
This project presents a system-level engineering study of the MetOp-A spacecraft, the first European meteorological satellite in polar orbit. 
The analysis includes mission objectives, subsystem design, and reverse engineering of key components.

Mission Objectives
Provide global meteorological data for weather forecasting, climate, and environmental monitoring.
Ensure continuous broadcast of data to worldwide users.
Support space weather monitoring (solar activity, charged particles).
Guarantee mission lifetime extension and compliance with space debris mitigation standards.

Subsystem Studies

1) Mission Analysis
Sun-synchronous orbit at 824 km altitude, inclination 98.7°.
∆V budget ~163 m/s with hydrazine monopropellant.
Orbit maintenance via in-plane and out-of-plane manoeuvres.

2) Propulsion
Eight monopropellant hydrazine thrusters (22.7 N each).
Blow-down pressurization with helium.
Redundant tank and thruster configuration for reliability.

3) Tracking, Telemetry & Telecommand (TTMTC)
S-band omnidirectional coverage for TT&C.
X-band high-rate downlink (70 Mbit/s) for science data.
Ground segment: Svalbard (Norway) + McMurdo (Antarctica) for reduced latency.

4) Attitude and Orbit Control (AOCS)
Multiple control modes (LEOP, routine ops, safe mode).
Reaction wheels + thrusters for actuation.
Star trackers, gyros, and Earth/Sun sensors for attitude determination.

5) Thermal Control System (TCS)
Radiators, insulation, and heaters for PLM & SVM.
Analysis of hot/cold cases and thermal fluxes.

6) Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS)
Solar arrays sized for BOL/EOL conditions.
Rechargeable batteries for eclipse phases.
Power regulation and distribution sized for all payloads.

7) On-Board Data Handling (OBDH)
Central OBC managing payloads and subsystems.
24 GB onboard solid-state recorder.
Real-time and stored data transmission.

8)Spacecraft Configuration
Payload and propulsion arranged within launcher fairing constraints.




Balanced configuration for stability and efficiency.
