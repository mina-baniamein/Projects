Interplanetary Mission
This MATLAB script simulates and optimizes an interplanetary mission trajectory consisting of:

1. Launch from Mercury within a specified departure window.
2. Gravity Assist (Flyby) at Venus while respecting atmospheric constraints.
3. Arrival at a target asteroid within a defined arrival window.
The program performs the following steps:

-Defines mission windows (launch, flyby, arrival) and planetary constants.
-Sweeps through possible launch/flyby/arrival dates to evaluate mission feasibility.
-Solves Lambert’s problem for each leg (Mercury → Venus, Venus → Asteroid) to compute transfer orbits.
-Calculates required ΔV for departure, planetary flyby, and asteroid insertion.
-Optimizes trajectory by finding the combination of dates that minimizes total ΔV.
-Models Venus flyby dynamics, checking that the closest approach is above the atmosphere and computing the actual turning angle of the hyperbola.
-Propagates orbits numerically for Mercury, Venus, the asteroid, and transfer arcs.
-Generates 3D trajectory plots:
-Full mission trajectory in the Solar System.
-Detailed incoming and outgoing Venus flyby hyperbolas.
-Outputs mission results including:
 -Optimal launch, flyby, and arrival dates.
 -Minimum ΔV requirements (departure, flyby maneuver, final rendezvous).
 -Closest flyby altitude and total time of flight.
