Interplanetary Mission
This MATLAB script simulates and optimizes an interplanetary mission trajectory consisting of:

1. Launch from Mercury within a specified departure window.
2. Gravity Assist (Flyby) at Venus while respecting atmospheric constraints.
3. Arrival at a target asteroid within a defined arrival window.

The program performs the following steps:
-Defines mission windows (launch, flyby, arrival) and planetary constants.
-Sweeps through possible launch/flyby/arrival dates to evaluate mission feasibility.
-Solves Lambert’s problem for each leg (Mercury → Venus, Venus → Asteroid) to compute transfer orbits.
-Calculates required ΔV for departure, planetary flyby, and asteroid insertion.
-Optimizes trajectory by finding the combination of dates that minimizes total ΔV.
-Models Venus flyby dynamics, checking that the closest approach is above the atmosphere and computing the actual turning angle of the hyperbola.
-Propagates orbits numerically for Mercury, Venus, the asteroid, and transfer arcs.
-Generates 3D trajectory plots:
-Full mission trajectory in the Solar System.
-Detailed incoming and outgoing Venus flyby hyperbolas.
-Outputs mission results including:
 -Optimal launch, flyby, and arrival dates.
 -Minimum ΔV requirements (departure, flyby maneuver, final rendezvous).
 -Closest flyby altitude and total time of flight.

Planetary mission
1) Unperturbed Orbit Propagation
Starts from given orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, RAAN, argument of perigee).
Propagates orbit using Keplerian two-body dynamics.
Computes and plots the ground track on Earth.
Verifies repeating ground track conditions for resonance (using ratio k/m).

2) Perturbed Orbit Propagation (J2, Drag, SRP)
Orbit is propagated again including Earth’s oblateness (J2), atmospheric drag, and solar radiation pressure.
Compares unperturbed vs. perturbed motion on orbital plots and ground tracks.
Shows how perturbations affect the trajectory and repetition of the ground track.

3) Comparison of Propagation Methods
Propagation is performed with:
Full Cartesian equations of motion.
Gauss’ variational equations (orbital elements form).
Computational times of both approaches are compared.
Evolution of orbital elements (a, e, i, Ω, ω, f) is plotted to highlight secular trends vs. short-period effects.
Relative errors between methods are computed.

4) Validation with Real Object (Debris ID 43247)
The same propagation models are applied to a real debris object.
Results are compared to ephemerides data (from NASA Horizons).
Semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, RAAN, and argument of perigee are plotted vs. time.
Filtering (moving average) is applied to highlight secular variations.
Demonstrates the accuracy of the perturbation models relative to real-world data.

Visual Outputs
3D orbits (Earth-centered, unperturbed & perturbed).
Ground tracks (with and without repetitions, unperturbed vs perturbed).
Time evolution plots of all orbital elements.
Relative error plots between propagation methods.
Comparison with real ephemerides data for object 43247.
