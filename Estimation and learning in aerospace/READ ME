Estimation and Learning project
This MATLAB/Simulink script is the main driver for simulating and identifying the longitudinal dynamics of the ANT-X UAV

1) Model Setup
Defines a 3-state longitudinal model (velocity, pitch rate, pitch angle) with input (pitching moment) and outputs (states + longitudinal acceleration).
Adds configurable noise and sensor/actuator delays.

2) Simulation
Loads controller parameters and excitation signals (e.g., ExcitationM, u3211).
Runs the Simulink simulator for single-axis dynamics with chosen input excitation.
Data Handling & Cross-Validation
Splits simulated data into training and validation sets.
Compares measured vs simulated outputs (pitch rate, acceleration) to check consistency.

3) Model Identification
Grey-box identification: estimates system matrices from physical model structure.
Black-box identification:
Performs spectral analysis & output-error modeling.
Uses PBSID (Prediction-Based Subspace Identification) to estimate state-space matrices.
Refines models via greyest structuring.

4) Model Comparison
Computes frequency responses (Bode plots) of real, grey-box, and PBSID models.
Evaluates identification errors and phase/magnitude discrepancies.

5) Validation
Runs the identified models on unseen data (cross-validation).
Plots results against simulation truth â†’ outputs vs predictions, and prediction errors.


Removes temporary files generated during simulation.
